# Github repo browser

Web application written in [Javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) to browse through github repositories. Displays repo issues and different contributors, stargazers (people who have given stars to a project) and subscribers.

Usage: user starts by writing the name of the repo to search for. Angular is the default, and a countdown timer will start the search if the search button is not pressed. The search results can be ordered by stars, programming language or name. Each item returned by the search can the inspected separately for people with various degrees of interest in the project.
